# Bendfords-Laws
Benford's law, also called the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, 
or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. 
The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small.[1] For example, 
in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, 
while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. 
I created this code so it can demonstrated benford's laws in stocks prices all around the market.
